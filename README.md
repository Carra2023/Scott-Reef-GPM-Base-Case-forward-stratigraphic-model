Scott Reef Base Case Forward Stratigraphic Model – README
Description

This dataset contains the base case forward stratigraphic model (FSM) of the North and South Scott Reef carbonate platforms on the North-West Shelf (Browse Basin, Australia). The model was developed using Schlumberger’s Petrel™ – GPM (Geological Process Modelling) module to investigate reef and carbonate platform evolution during the Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MPT; ~1.2–0.7 Ma).

The base case represents a calibrated scenario that integrates available observational constraints, including:

Seismic sequence stratigraphic architecture (Williams et al., 2023)

Well and core data (Hook-1P/3P, NRSEHDD3JA, SRSEBH6J)

Chronostratigraphic ages from U/Th dating

Modern bathymetry and geomorphology

Regional sea-level reconstructions (Miller et al., 2020)

The model was iteratively calibrated to reproduce the large-scale sediment thickness, platform geometries, and facies distributions observed in seismic and core datasets.

Contents

Petrel™ GPM project JSON and HDI5 files containing the base case model input data and parameters.

Input data (paleobathymetry, subsidence, eustatic sea-level curve, carbonate production functions, wave energy map)


Purpose

The base case is intended as a reference model for testing hypotheses on the relative roles of sea-level, subsidence, and ecological controls on carbonate platform evolution. It also serves as the foundation for sensitivity experiments exploring reef response to changes in boundary conditions (e.g., sea-level amplitude, carbonate production rates, ecological depth limits).

Limitations

The GPM algorithm does not model tidal or current processes. Diagenetic processes can be modelled but have not been incorporated into this model.

Results should be interpreted as conceptual scenarios rather than deterministic reconstructions.

The model timestep resolution  is 1 kyr.
